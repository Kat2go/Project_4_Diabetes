## About
In the final project of Group 2's project for the DU Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp, team members Katrina Brown, Triston Cavaness, Lesley Conn and Juliet Hamilton
## Tools
* Python
* PANDAS
* pathlib
* pyspark
* sklearn.metrics
## Analysis
The data was imported, reviewed for nonnulls and data types and split into the target and feature variables, followed by a train-test split. A logistic regression model was applied to the test portion, resulting in predictions. Evaluation metrics, including balanced accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report, were computed to assess the model's performance.
One limitation of data is lack of ethnicity


## Results
**Logistic Regression on Training Data:**  
* Balanced accuracy score: %  
* Precision: %  
* Recall: %
